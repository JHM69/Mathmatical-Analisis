## Mathematical Analysis

This project includes implementations of the following mathematical concepts:

- **Euler Totient Function:** Used in number theory to denote the count of positive integers up to a given number n that are coprime (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1) with n.

- **Exponent Mod Calculator:** Function used in calculations involving modular exponentiation, which is commonly used in computer science, cryptography, and number theory.

- **Multiplicative Inverse Calculator:** Computes the multiplicative inverse of a given number, a, modulo m, which is often used in cryptographic algorithms and other areas of number theory.

- **Stirling Number:** Used in combinatorics, the study of counting and arranging objects. Stirling numbers of the first kind count the number of permutations of n objects with k permutation cycles, and Stirling numbers of the second kind count the number of ways to partition a set of n objects into k non-empty subsets.

- **Eulerian Number:** Used in combinatorics to count certain types of permutations. Specifically, the Eulerian number A(n, k) counts the number of permutations of the numbers from 1 to n in which exactly k numbers are greater than the previous number (these are called "ascents").
